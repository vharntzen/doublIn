Description: Visualize contact tracing data using a 'Shiny' app and estimate the incubation or latency time of an infectious disease respecting the following characteristics in the analysis; (i) doubly interval censoring with (partly) overlapping or distinct windows; (ii) an infection risk corresponding to exponential growth; (iii) right truncation allowing for individual truncation times; (iv) different choices concerning the family of the distribution. For our earlier work, we refer to Arntzen et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/sim.9726>. A paper describing our approach in detail will follow.
